# RL Experiments

This repository is aimed to store all my RL paper implementations and also my personal tweaks to the algorithms.
Hopefully this repo will help people who quickly want to get in the beautiful world of RL.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### TODOS

* [main.py]Change the per time step policy update to episodic policy update.
* [utils.py]Comment the util functions.


### Prerequisites

Install all the packages listed in the requirements file.
```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

### Run Agent

After installing all the dependencies run main.py to start training.
Press CTRL-C to stop training and enter the .pth file name to save the model.

```
python main.py
```




## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The deep learning framework used
* [OpenAI](https://gym.openai.com/) - Environment Framework
* [Conda](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Package Management
